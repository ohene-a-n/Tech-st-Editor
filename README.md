   - Organized the layout with frames and packed widgets accordingly.

2. **Implementing Core Functionalities**:
   - **File Operations**: Implemented methods for creating new files, opening existing files, and saving files.
   - **Edit Operations**: Added functionalities for cut, copy, paste, and undo operations.

3. **Enhancing User Experience**:
   - **Search Functionality**: Implemented a search widget that highlights search results within the text.
   - **Find & Replace**: Added a widget for finding and replacing text in the document.
   - **Information Bar**: Displayed the current count of lines, words, and characters dynamically as the user types.

4. **Handling User Interactions**:
   - Used event bindings to handle key presses and menu selections.
   - Added command routing to ensure the correct function is called based on user actions.

### Results

The resulting application is a functional text editor that allows users to perform basic text editing operations and provides additional features to improve usability. The information bar and search functionalities are particularly useful for users working with larger documents.
